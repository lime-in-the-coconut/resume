		<h1>This bit is about why you should interview me...</h1>
		<p>I am an expert in 3D découpage, a champion knitter of hats for penguins, and an outlaw in 7 South American countries.  I have been known to remodel city parks on my lunch break, making them more beneficial to animals with respect to oxygen generation.</p> 
		<p>I won the Iditarod with a team of precision trained ferrets.  I hold the national title for full contact calligraphy.  I am defeating hunger in South Asia with my hybrid cross of kudzu and spaghetti squash.  Small woodland creatures come when I sing, and I have, in my possession, the only surviving lock of Samson’s hair and mating pair of Raphus cucullatus.</p>
		<p>Using only a canteen of water and a small pack of sparklers, I once single-handedly defended a small village in Yemen from a plague of swarming locusts.  867-5309 is really my phone number.</p>
		<p>I interpret baseball commentaries for Vietnamese refugees, I write pulitzer prize winning articles about the atrocities in Somalia, I am a multi-tasking marvel.  Occasionally, I intentionally slow my heart rate to that of a diving harbor seal.</p>
		<p>I woo audiences with my sensuous execution of ‘Bolero’ on the electric jazz flute, I can ride a skateboard up a devilish incline with incredible speed, and I complete the 20 minute workout in 10 minutes.  I speak fluent Sumerian.</p>
		<p>Schrodinger’s cat escaped his sealed box and chooses to live in my attic.  I am the subject of numerous National Geographic documentaries, and when I’m bored I redesign roller coasters to maximize G-force and minimize vertigo.  My bird in the hand is worth three in the bush.</p>
		<p>I am a saltwater analyst, a benevolent ruler, and my mixed media paper maché/recycled Christmas tinsel sculptures are on permanent display at MOMA.  I built a to-scale reproduction of the Eiffel Tower in my courtyard. I have been the tenth caller and gone on to win the entire grand prize. I weep at Hallmark commercials and look even better afterwards.</p>
		<p>I am endorsed for time travel.  I never swat flies, they just leave if I ask politely. I read the Rise and Fall of the Third Reich in one afternoon and still had time to cook a seven course meal for visiting dignitaries.</p>
		<p>I can identify every species of bird by smell.  I have been a covert operative for the CIA and MI6. I sleep once a week and during that respite, I write operettas. Newton’s first and third laws have no effect on me.
		I have never bounced a check, I have invented 17 fonts; a mix of serif and sans-serif, and last week, I fabricated an entire dining room suite made of origami.</p>  
		<p>I once broke a U.N. impasse with a hand-carved pumpkin.  I breed prizewinning snails; both for racing and appetizers.</p>
		<p>I would be honored to add “creates stellar code by profession and for fun” to my list.
		</p>
